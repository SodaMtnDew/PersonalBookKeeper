# PersonalBookKeeper
Application developed using .NET framework &amp; MS-SQL Express, could help people easily record, monitor &amp; review their financial status.

After Installing MS-SQL Express (with default instance, same as other versions of MS-SQL, preventing using SQLExpress) & SMSS, open 2 sql files to create database & schema. After that, using VS 2022 Community Version to open sln file and compile the release version. Now you can use PersonalBookKeeper to help you achieving your financial freedom.

My test db (with sql files uploaded) will be uploaded later; those need other language version, just modify the resource strings of the project to get what you like.
